\title{Identifies groups with intragroup pairwise distances less than maxDiff}
\usage{
groupSimilarityMatrixTree(dists, maxDiff)
}
\arguments{
\item{dists}{is a matrix object with pairwise retention time distances.}

\item{maxDiff}{is the maximum pairwise distance between members of a group.}
}
\value{
\code{integers} representing groups of peaks based on retention times.
Should be of the same length as the feature definitions.
}
\description{
Searches through a complete clustering tree for branches with internal
distances less than maxDiff.
}
\details{
The search is performed top-down so that every node is evaluated for
qualifying as a group.
If the node does not qualify the algorithm iterates to the next node in the
tree. If the node qualifies, all members are added as a group to the \emph{groups
vector} and all following child nodes are skipped.
