#' @title Grouping of sorted values into sets with smallest differences
#'
#' @description
#'
#' `groupConsecutive` groups **sorted** values in `x` for which the difference
#' is smaller than `maxDiff`. As a result, the mean difference between the
#' groups will always be larger than `maxDiff`, but difference between
#' individual values within the same group (e.g. between the first and last)
#' can be larger `maxDiff`.
#'
#' In detail, from the sorted `x`, the function starts from the smallest value
#' defining the first group as the one containing all values in `x` with a
#' difference to this first value which is `<= maxDiff`.
#' The next group is the defined based on the next larger value that is not part
#' of the first group and includes all values with a difference `<= maxDiff` to
#' this value. For values fulfilling this criteria but being already part of
#' a previous group, the differences to the mean value of the current group
#' and to the mean of previous groups are compared and values are assigned to
#' the group to which they have the smallest difference.
#'
#' Example: values `1.1, 1.9, 2.2` should be grouped with a `maxDiff = 1`. The
#' first group is defined to include all values for which the difference to the
#' first value (`1.1`) is smaller `maxDiff`. Thus, the first group is defined
#' to contain values `1.1 and 1.9`. Then the next group is defined based on the
#' next larger value not part of any group, `2.2`. This group contains values
#' `1.9` and `2.2` with the value `1.9` being already assigned to the first
#' group. The difference between this value `1.9` and the mean of the
#' current group (`mean(c(1.9, 2.2)`) is then compared to the difference of
#' `1.9` to the mean value of the group `1.9` is already part of
#' (which is `mean(c(1.1, 1.9))`). Since the difference to the second group is
#' smaller, `1.9` is removed from the first group and assigned to the second
#' one.
#'
#' @note
#'
#' The difference between consecutive (ordered) values within a defined group
#' is always `<= maxDiff`, but the difference between e.g. the first and the
#' last of the (ordered) values can be larger than `maxDiff`. See
#' [groupClosest()] for a more stringent grouping function.
#'
#' @param x `numeric` of values that should be grouped.
#'
#' @param maxDiff `numeric(1)` defining the threshold for difference between
#'     values in `x` to be grouped into the same group.
#'
#' @return `integer` with the group assignment (values grouped together have
#'     the same return value).

#' @title Group rows of a diagonal matrix using a threshold
#'
#' @description
#'
#' This function groups elements (rows or columns) of a diagonal matrix, such as
#' a pairwise correlation matrix or similarity matrix, with a value `>=
#' threshold`. This creates clusters of elements in which **all** elements have
#' a value `>= threshold` with **any** other element in that cluster. On a
#' correlation matrix (such as created with `cor`) it will generate small
#' clusters of highly correlated elements. Note however that single elements in
#' one cluster could also have a correlation `>= threshold` to another element
#' in another cluster. The average similarity to its own cluster will however
#' be higher to that of the other.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The algorithm is defined as follows:
#' - all pairs of values in `x` which are `>= threshold` are identified and
#'   sorted decreasingly.
#' - starting with the pair with the highest correlation, groups are defined:
#' - if none of the two is in a group, both are put into the same new group.
#' - if one of the two is already in a group, the other is put into the same
#'   group if **all** correlations of it to that group are `>= threshold`
#'   (and are not `NA`).
#' - if both are already in the same group nothing is done.
#' - if both are in different groups: an element is put into the group of the
#'   other if a) all correlations of it to members of the other's group
#'   are not `NA` and `>= threshold` **and** b) the average correlation to the
#'   other group is larger than the average correlation to its own group.
#'
#' This ensures that groups are defined in which all elements have a correlation
#' `>= threshold` with each other and the correlation between members of the
#' same group is maximized.
#'
#' @param x symmetrix `numeric` `matrix`.
#'
#' @param threshold `numeric(1)` above which rows in `x` should be grouped.
#'
#' @param full `logical(1)` whether the full matrix should be considered, or
#'     just the upper triangular matrix (including the diagonal).
#'
#' @param ... ignored.
#'
#' @return `integer` same length than `nrow(x)`, grouped elements (rows) defined
#'     by the same value.
