is smaller than maxDiff. As a result, the mean difference between the
groups will always be larger than maxDiff, but difference between
individual values within the same group (e.g. between the first and last)
can be larger maxDiff.
In detail, from the sorted x, the function starts from the smallest value
defining the first group as the one containing all values in x with a
difference to this first value which is &amp;lt;= maxDiff.
The next group is the defined based on the next larger value that is not part
of the first group and includes all values with a difference &amp;lt;= maxDiff to
this value. For values fulfilling this criteria but being already part of
a previous group, the differences to the mean value of the current group
and to the mean of previous groups are compared and values are assigned to
the group to which they have the smallest difference.
Example: values 1.1, 1.9, 2.2 should be grouped with a maxDiff = 1. The
first group is defined to include all values for which the difference to the
first value (1.1) is smaller maxDiff. Thus, the first group is defined
to contain values 1.1 and 1.9. Then the next group is defined based on the
next larger value not part of any group, 2.2. This group contains values
1.9 and 2.2 with the value 1.9 being already assigned to the first
group. The difference between this value 1.9 and the mean of the
current group (mean(c(1.9, 2.2)) is then compared to the difference of
1.9 to the mean value of the group 1.9 is already part of
(which is mean(c(1.1, 1.9))). Since the difference to the second group is
smaller, 1.9 is removed from the first group and assigned to the second
one."><meta property="og:description" content="groupConsecutive groups sorted values in x for which the difference
